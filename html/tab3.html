<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression: <br /> </li>
  -Linear regression by means of different data predicts and analyzes the value of some unknown variable that one wants to find, according to the data collected in my graph we managed to see a progressive decrease in the monthly energy expenditure of my house classifying my data as a notorious example of a decreasing regression, in simple words as each month decreases the kWh of energy. <br />

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors: <br /> </li>
  -Analyzing differences and relationships in the location of points representing energy consumption and graph regression, it is possible to observe a separation of almost 50 kWh in months 1 and 2 and in the other months a smaller separation or less than the first months is analyzed, so I consider my graph in an intermediate way where there are differences. <br />
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that: <br /> </li>
    -Y= -19.80 (6) +126.60 = 7,8
    -R=/ It is estimated that next month 7,8 KW
    will be consumed. <br />
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy. <br /> </li>
    
    -I conclude that in my family there is a dramatic decrease in the consume of energy, it is a particular case because there is four people living in the house but we only spend below 100kwh, this happens because we have many ways to save energy.
  
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression:</li>
  <br />
    -The linear regression is presented starting from 120 KWH y increases to 210
    KWH.
    <li>
      <p>-The relation among the dots regarding the colors:<br /></p>
    </li>
    -The red points do not have an order and are very irregular.<br />
    <li>
      Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where
      $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: <br />
      <p>- y=(32.29)(200)+49.57=6507.57 <br /></p>

      <p>
        - R=/ The energy that will be consumed in a unit is 6507.57 KW <br />
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
      between these two variables: <br /> </li>
      
    -This linear regression just increases till 210 and the dots are irregular, the conclusion is that when in a house there is more people they will spend more energy, we can also see some exceptions like a family of four spending just 100 kwh, ir depends in how each family saves the sources. <br />
