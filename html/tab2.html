<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression:</li>
  <br />
  -The linear regression of this graph that collects the various monthly energy
  expenses in my house presents a sustained behavior, over the course of the
  months you can see a very slight decrease, but a regression prevails in which
  data does not grow or decrease markedly.
  <br />

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors:</li>
  <br />

   -Analyzing the different results of the graph and the different locations of
  the points representing the relationships between the data, it is possible to
  rescue a relationship where in large part the points are maintained together
  or near the graph except for month 3 which presents a difference however in
  greater totality the energy expenditure remains similar each month.
  <br />

  
   <li> Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that: <br /> </li>

  -Y= -4.80 (6) +157.60 =128.8 <br /> <p>
  -R=/ It is estimated that next month 128.8 KW will be consumed. <br />
    
        <li> A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.  <br /> <p> </li>

      -I can conclude that in my family we have a regular consume of the energy, we dont see drastic increases or decreases, and we dont spend too much energy because we are a family of four. <br/>
  </p>
</ul>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression:<br />
    <p>
      -The linear regression stars at 100 KWH but there is an increase until it
      reaches 700 KWH.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors: <br />
    <p>
      -The red points are close but not above the linear regression.
    </p>
  </li>

      <li> Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: <br />   </li>
    <p>
      -y=(117.73)(200)+-251.38=23294.62 <br /> 
<p> 
  -R=/ The energy that will be consumed in a unit is 23294.62 KW <br /></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables:<br />
  </li>
  -We conclude that when the family is of three or four they are bit going to
  spend too much energy, in the other hand when the house has Many people It’s
  going to spend more energy, for example the family of seven spend more than
  700 kwh.<br />
