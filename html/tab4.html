<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual.
For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression: <br /> </li>
-In the linear regression factor of this graph we can observe a similarity with the graph of my companion Juliana, where both statistics decrease however in this the decrease in energy use every month is more noticeable and decreasing. <br />

<li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors: <br /> </li>
-By studying the location of the consumption and regression points in the statistics, it is well known that the behavior of energy consumption in relation to regression is very dispersed, where the proximity of the data varies greatly, which shows that every month changes occur in the monthly energy of the house. <br />

<li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: <br /> </li>
-Y=-2.40 (6) + 179.80 = 165.4
-R=/ It is estimated that next month 7,8 KW
    will be consumed. <br />
<li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy: <br /> </li>

-In my case I can see a decrease in the use of energy in my house,  the month of december is the one that increase the most, this happen because we were in christmas, but after that month the energy started to decrease, and in my family we saved more energy.
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression: </li> <br />
         
         - The linear regression is presented starting from below 200 KWH and 
         increases to approximately 510 KWH.<br />
         
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors:</li> <br />
        
         - The red points are scattered and not above the linear regression.<br /> 
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: </li> <br />
         <p>
         - y=(85.33)(200)+ -161.00=16905 <br />
         - R=/ The energy that will be consumed in a unit is 16905 KW <br />
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
         <p>
          -In the linear regression the evidence tell me that when more people live in a house the energy will increase, but here are some exceptions, like the house of six people that only spends 96kwh or the house that with only four people they spend 200kwh, it depends in How each family take care of the use of energy.
        </ul>
